### Project Overview

 This project is based on making prediction for the future price(dependent variable) of lego sets based on various attributes (independent variables) using linear regression model.


### Learnings from the project

 To make linear regression models and to minimize the residual errors to make accurate predictions


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I first cleaned the data for feeding it into the training model for linear regression model by analyzing and determining if there are any multi-collinearity between independent variables, null values and wrangled data to minimize the residual errors.
Used OLS( ordinary least squares) to find the best fit line.The linear regression model is implemented using python functions and scikitlearn
