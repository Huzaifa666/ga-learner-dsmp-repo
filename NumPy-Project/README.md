### Project Overview

 Created a project emphasized on numPy's computational capabilities and its uses


### Learnings from the project

 - NumPy array Formation
- NumPy array slicing, indexing
- NumPy array advantages over python lists
- NumPy array use in real 



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Instead of using normal python lists, i usedthe NumPy arrays to increase the computational speed of the program as well as require less space than what Python lists requires. Used basic operations of NumPy on a dataset of 1001 people which consisted of age, sex, education, income, capital gain, capital loss, hours-per-week, income.

Derived aspects on :-
- How many people are old or young 
- How many people are highly educated and what is the relation between their education and their salary 
- Which race is of the minority in the given dataset


### Challenges faced

 - Deriving a numpy array from another numPy array
